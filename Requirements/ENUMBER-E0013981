Kevin Davis SMART Action Plan for Requirements
S-Specific:  
1.	The game only allows one user.
2.	User must write down a food that they would like to eat.
3.	The game will ask questions to the user.
4.	After asking a question, the program will guess what food user thought of.
5.	The program should ask no more than 21 questions.
6.	If the program guesses correctly, then the user is notified that she/he lost.
7.	User wins only if computer runs out of questions and guesses incorrectly on all guesses.
8.	There is a 5-minute time limit.
9.	After 5 minutes, game ends.
10.	Game ends if program answers correctly. 
M-Measurable: Test cases will be ran on all 10 requirements to see if all requirements are filled.
A-Achievable: There is a total of 5 programmers. Each programmer will be responsible for implementing and testing each requirement.
R-Relevant: Each requirement is relevant. Resources that will be used are programmers in the C# environment. 
T: Implementation and test cases are due by October 1st at 5PM.
