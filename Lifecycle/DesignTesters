Team Members: Reece, Oaks, Campbell, Farmer, Mink

Requirements: Asking clarifying questions so that all intended functionality is captured.
Design: Initial review of requirements and brainstorming of methods to implement functionality.
Implementation: The actual coding of functionality to match the design plan.
Testing: Using test cases to ensure that all requirements are met.
Release: Pushing of product once it is finished and has been tested.
Support/Maintenance: Fixes of released code bugs/functionality that did not completely meet the requirements. 
Upgrades/Updates: Large scale changes that are beyond the scope of the initial requirements and add functionality after the release. 

Key Aspects of the Requirements Phase:
- Asking clarifying questions while meeting with the customer.
- An understanding of why the requirements exist if possible.
- Ensuring that as many requirements are known as possible.
- In which order the requirements have to be completed (are certain requirements a prerequisite for others).
- Categorization of mandatory and optional requirements.
- Categorization of types of requirements (functional, performance, etc.)
- A Software Requirements Specification document.
- A traceability matrix.
- Knowledge of contact points regarding status updates, acceptance, etc.

Key Aspects of the Design Phase:
- Knowledge of how to implement the requirements.
- Brainstorming of ideas for the methods of implementing the functionality.
- Establishing Priorities for the tasks that need to be completed.
- Creation of design documents that map to the requirements like UML diagrams, traceability matrices, etc.
- Constraints set for the Implementation phase about how much work is expected to be done in what amount of time by what people, etc.

Key Aspects of the Implementation Phase:
- Actual coding and creation of the project solution.
- Unit tests and small test cases for small internal bugs.
- Results in a functional version of the project that can then be tested to ensure full functionality and meeting of requirements.
- Usually more people involved than in the previous phases.
- Self documented code through comments.
- Completion of the tasks in the design phase by an order of priority.
- Documentation of code and functionality in an additional document (like a README file).

Key Aspects of the Testing Phase:
- Usually done by a different team than the implementation team (call Quality Assurance).
- Ensures that the project solution meets all requirements and functionality.
- Larger tests that cover the entire project. 
- Additional tests like user acceptance and approval.

Key Aspects of the Release Phase:
- Delivery of a finished product that meets all requirements to the customer.

Key Aspects of the Support/Maintenance Phase:
- Small bug fixes and patches that do not add functionality. 

Key Aspects of the Upgrades/Updates Phase:
- Additional features that are added to the product outside of the initial scope.
