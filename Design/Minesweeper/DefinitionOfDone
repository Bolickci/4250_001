What does being done mean?
-	We have a traceability matrix.
-	We have an idea of how to code every requirement/feature. 
-	Map of what is most critical and what needs to be designed first and in what order to design things.
So, essentially we know what to do, how to code it, and then the order in which to code it.

Starting off by identifying what needs to be done first so that we can then design it first and use its design to influence the design for the additional features.
