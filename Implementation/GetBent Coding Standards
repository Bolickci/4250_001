*******************************************************************

Unit Testing 

A JavaScript testing framework will be utilized for unit testing. One of the following would be used: (Jest, Mocha, Jasmine, AVA)

*******************************************************************


Code Review

We will be applying the principles of the main eight "ilities" to make sure code fulfills each of these in a sufficient manner. (Functionality, Readability, Modularization, Performance, Security, Tests, Error Handling, Code Style)

*******************************************************************


Source Control Approach

-- Project will consist of a single Repository with three version branches. The three version branches will consist of Developer -> Quality Assurance (QA) -> and Production / Live. From each of these branches, feature branches will be created and linked to their relevant sprint through naming. 

-- Developers will commit will pull and commit their code twice a day. Once at the beginning of the day, and once at the end of the day. 

-- In the case of a merge conflict, the authors of both units of code will correspond with each other in a code review format. Merge conflicts will be documented or future review if necessary.
